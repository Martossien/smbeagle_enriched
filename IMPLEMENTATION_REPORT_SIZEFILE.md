# Implementation Report --sizefile

## Modified Files
- `Program.cs`: added `--sizefile` option and passed to `FileFinder`; added example.
- `FileDiscovery/File.cs`: added `FileSize` property and constructor parameter.
- `FileDiscovery/Output/FileOutput.cs`: outputs the new `FileSize` field.
- `FileDiscovery/Directory.cs`: updated file discovery methods to optionally record file sizes.
- `FileDiscovery/FileFinder.cs`: accepts a new parameter to propagate the option to directories.
- `README.md`: documented the new command line flag.

## Testing
- **Build**: `dotnet build SMBeagle.sln` succeeded.
- **Help**: `dotnet run -- --help` shows the `--sizefile` option.
- **Python tests**: attempted `pytest` but failed because required environment variables and services were unavailable in this environment.

## Issues
- Python integration tests require a special environment with `ROOTDIR` and SMB server setup. These were not available so tests failed.

## Recommendations
- Future metadata flags can follow the same approach: extend `File` and `FileOutput`, propagate options via `FileFinder` and `Directory`.
